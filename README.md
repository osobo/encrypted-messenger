A simple "instant messenger" for the ChipKit UNO32 board with encrypted messages. The key exchange is done with Diffie Hellman and the cipher used is ChaCha20. I have implemented all the crypto in the project itself. To implement diffie hellman I have also implemented basic arbitrary-precision arithmetic. For message authentication and RNG I created a simple keccak-inspired hash function called `spoch`.
